# backend/utils/mesh_orientation.py
# Decide the simulated orientation of every face from air-visibility hits.
#
# pyroomacoustics convention: a wall's normal points AWAY from the air
# (out of the room / into solids), and only two-sided walls reflect from both
# sides. The decision is hierarchical so that sparse or noisy ray hits never
# produce inconsistent surfaces:
#
#   1. Closed, orientable welded components (rooms, solids) are oriented as a
#      whole by a majority vote; they are never two-sided.
#   2. Objects made of loose (unwelded) faces that still enclose a volume
#      ("closed boxes" such as furniture, or a room shell of loose panels) are
#      oriented geometrically: normals point into the enclosed volume when it
#      is solid, out of it when it holds the air; never two-sided.
#   3. Open orientable manifold components (panels, sheets) are voted as a whole and
#      become two-sided only when the air clearly reaches both sides.
#   4. Non-manifold / non-orientable components fall back to per-face votes.
#   5. Two-sidedness is smoothed per object (area-weighted majority).

    Parity test on one object's faces.

    From points on each face, count crossings of the object's other faces
    along +normal and -normal. For a closed object exactly one direction
    crosses an odd number of surfaces: that direction points into the volume.
    Several off-centre sample points vote, because a ray through the centroid
    of a symmetric face often grazes the shared diagonal of the opposite quad
    (counted twice, flipping the parity).

    Returns:
        ``(inward_sign (k,), share)`` with +1 when the normal already points
        inward, -1 when it must flip; ``share`` is the fraction of faces the
        parity test decided (the rest fall back to the object centroid).
